# Numeral Dash
Gameplay mechanics:
1. Player needs to collect all numbers from the map.
2. Numbers have to be collected in a given order, which at the moment alternates between sequential and reverse order.
3. Player can carry one number in their inventory for later use. It will be used automatically if the right number is collected. It may be replaced with a different number.

## Controls:

Arrow buttons to move (fast with the left shift), F5 to switch full screen, Esc to pause and exit.

Control and shift can be combined together during auto move to stop at both of the above.
