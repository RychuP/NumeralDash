# Numeral Dash
Gameplay mechanics:
1. Player needs to collect all numbers from the map.
2. Numbers have to be collected in the given order which at the moment alternates between sequential and reverse.
3. Player can carry one number in their inventory for later use. It will be used automatically when the right number is collected.

## Controls:

1. Arrow buttons to move, F5 to switch full screen, Esc to pause and exit.
2. Left shift when held will make the player auto move stopping automatically when perpendicular to a number.
3. Left control when held will make the player auto move stopping automatically at road intersections.
4. Control and shift can be combined together during auto move to stop at both of the above.

## Frameworks:

.NET 6,
